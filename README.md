# first of all this is about having fun, so be Cool :)

The purpose of this section of the website depicted in the wireframe,  is to allow users to select the parts of the machine they want to order, fill it in the Sales Order Form (burger menu) and move on to next step. <b>
The idea is to implement the form in a way that it can be opened and closed whenever the user wishes to do so. <b>
The information the user puts in the form is supposed to be saved for as long as the user is on that site.  <b>
For your better understanding and reference we have attached the actual picture and description of the parts.  <b>

Good luck and enjoy!
